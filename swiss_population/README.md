# swiss_population


This project is intended to explore and expand my data analysis skills in Python and R. 

The data for this project was collected from the [Swiss STAT-TAB](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/en/px-x-0102010000_104/-/px-x-0102010000_104.px) website for the year 2016. 

This dataset will be explored to answer the question of where non permanent residents, specifically Canadians, lived in Switzerland in 2016. The hypothesis for this project is the majority (>50%) of non permanent residents born outside of Switzerland, specifically Canada, lived in major city centres in 2016. For this project, major city centres are defined as Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Lausanne, and Bern, as all have populations greater than 125,000 inhabitants. 

In order to summarize the data, proportions of non permanent residents living in city centres will be calculated. This includes filtering for Canadians. The data will be visualized as proportions on a map of Switzerland, generated using R.
